Hi, I’m Eugene O’Sullivan — an experienced architect and lead developer, currently focusing on building robust, secure, and standards-driven healthcare data services for NHS Wales. I have a deep background in Google Cloud, FHIR standards, and leading cloud-native solutions at national scale.

Outside of work, I’m a passionate musician and guitarist, playing everything from Kings of Leon and Supergrass to The Cure and The Verve. I also coach youth rugby with Llandaff RFC, enjoy spending time with my family, and keep active with regular walks and sports.

This site is where I share my thoughts, experiments, and notes on cloud architecture, FHIR interoperability, coding tips, and the occasional music or rugby tangent.

> If you’re interested in collaborating or just want to talk tech, music, or rugby, feel free to get in touch.
