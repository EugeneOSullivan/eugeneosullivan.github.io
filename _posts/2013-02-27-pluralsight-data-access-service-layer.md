I came across a valuable free video from Pluralsight that covers implementing a service layer pattern for data access in .NET applications.

The service layer pattern is a crucial architectural pattern that helps to:
- Separate business logic from data access
- Improve code organization and maintainability
- Make the application more testable
- Provide a clear boundary between different layers of the application

While the original video link is no longer available, the concepts of implementing a service layer remain relevant. Here are the key points typically covered in such implementations:

1. **Service Layer Responsibilities**
   - Business logic orchestration
   - Transaction management
   - Data access coordination
   - Cross-cutting concerns

2. **Common Implementation Patterns**
   - Repository pattern integration
   - Unit of Work pattern
   - Dependency Injection
   - Interface-based design

3. **Best Practices**
   - Keep services focused and single-responsibility
   - Use interfaces for better testability
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Consider async/await patterns for scalability

The service layer pattern continues to be a fundamental part of enterprise application architecture, and understanding its implementation is valuable for any .NET developer.
