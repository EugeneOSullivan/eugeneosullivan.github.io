description: "A brief note on relaunching my blog, recovering old posts, and sharing new content."

---

After a long hiatus, I'm relaunching my blog. Over the years, I've written a lot about web development, technology, and the occasional quick tip. Much of that content was lost to timeâ€”or so I thought.

Recently, I've been able to recover and import many of my old posts from the Wayback Machine and other archives. You'll find a mix of new content and rescued articles from my original blog, some dating back over a decade.

I hope you enjoy this blend of old and new. Feel free to explore the archives, I'm going to set up a [portfolio](/portfolio) and [playground](/playground) soon hopefully.
