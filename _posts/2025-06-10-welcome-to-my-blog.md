After a long hiatus, I'm excited to relaunch my blog! Over the years, I've written a lot about web development, technology, and the occasional quick tip. Much of that content was lost to timeâ€”or so I thought.

Recently, I've been able to recover and import many of my old posts from the Wayback Machine and other archives. You'll find a mix of new content and rescued articles from my original blog, some dating back over a decade.

### What's New (and Old)
- **Archived Posts:** Many classic posts have been restored, preserving their original spirit (and sometimes quirks!).
- **Fresh Start:** I'll be sharing new thoughts, experiments, and projects as I continue my journey in tech.

If you're a returning reader, welcome back! If you're new, I hope you enjoy this blend of old and new. Feel free to explore the archives, check out the [portfolio](/portfolio), or try something in the [playground](/playground).

Thanks for joining me as I reboot this space and bring the best of the past into the present.
