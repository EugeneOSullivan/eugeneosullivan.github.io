Dan Wahlin has created an excellent video tutorial that introduces the key features of AngularJS in about 60 minutes. This is a great resource for developers who want to get started with AngularJS:

[Watch AngularJS Fundamentals in 60-ish Minutes](http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/archive/2013/04/12/video-tutorial-angularjs-fundamentals-in-60-ish-minutes.aspx)

The tutorial covers essential AngularJS concepts and features, making it an ideal starting point for developers new to the framework. While AngularJS has evolved significantly since this video was created, many of the fundamental concepts remain relevant and provide a solid foundation for understanding modern Angular development.

Key topics covered in the tutorial include:
- AngularJS architecture and core concepts
- Controllers and data binding
- Directives and filters
- Services and dependency injection
- Routing and navigation

This video is particularly valuable for developers transitioning from traditional web development to modern JavaScript frameworks.
